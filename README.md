# Pere's Mathelevator
Personal project: Game proto made in Unity in which players must answer to math problems while sending people arriving by elevator to their designated destination (red or blue).

Current test graphics made with primitive 2D shapes; graphics will be replaced with low poly 3D models later.

No playable version available on net, yet. Current project made and tested on Unity version 2020.3.44f1. Feel free to download and try it out. :)
