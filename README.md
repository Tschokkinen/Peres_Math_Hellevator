# Peres_Math_Hellevator
Personal project: Game proto made in Unity in which players must answer to math problems while sending souls to a proper destination.

Work in progress.

Current test graphics made with primitive 2D shapes. Will be replaced with low poly 3D models later.

No playable version available on net, yet. Current project made and tested on Unity version 2020.3.44f1.
